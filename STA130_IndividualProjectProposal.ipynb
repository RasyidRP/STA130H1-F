    "\n",
    "### I. Analysis I: Confidence in Social Respect and Community Volunteering\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Research Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a link between individuals' confidence in being respected and their frequency of community volunteering? Estimating this could reveal if social confidence aligns with community engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Variables**\n",
    "- Confidence in Respect (PSYCH_attachment_style_questionnaire_secure_respect): Measures individuals' confidence in others' respect toward them.\n",
    "- Volunteering Frequency (CONNECTION_activities_community_p3m): Counts volunteer activities over the past three months.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use scatter plots for linear association, histograms for distribution and outlier detection, and box plots for data distribution summaries for the visualizations. The summary statistics are the mean, median, and range for each variable assess central tendencies and dispersion.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**C. Analysis Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the method, we use the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) to quantify the strength and direction of the linear association between Confidence in Respect and Volunteering Frequency. Use scipy.stats library in Python to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient. Our assumptions are: linearity, homoscedasticity, and absence of extreme outliers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**D. Result Hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect a positive correlation, suggesting that individuals with higher Confidence in Respect might engage more frequently in community volunteering. A positive correlation may indicate a feedback loop between confidence and community engagement, offering insights into social behavior and well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "### II.\tAnalysis II: Work-Life Balance and Perceived Stress\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Research Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "How does self-reported work-life balance impact perceived stress levels? Understanding this relationship can provide insight into well-being and work adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Variables**\n",
    "- Work-Life Balance (LIFESTYLE_time_use_balance_working): Rates the balance between work and life based on time spent working.\n",
    "- Perceived Stress (BELIEFS_rank_work_stress): Reflects the stress levels from work-related stress of each individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use box plots to observe stress distribution across balance levels and histograms to view stress distribution patterns for the visualizations. The summary statistics are the mean, median, IQR, and standard deviation of stress for each work-life balance group.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**C.\tAnalysis Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the method, we use Two-sample bootstrapping test comparing stress levels for high vs. low work-life balance. Resampling with replacement within each group creates a distribution of bootstrapped mean differences. A 95% confidence interval for the difference in means will be calculated using np.quantile() in Python. Our assumptions are: equal variances and independence between groups.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**D. Result Hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that higher work-life balance scores may correlate with lower stress, indicating the importance of balance in mental well-being. Findings could inform workplace policies and strategies for stress reduction and work-life integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### III.\tAnalysis III: Social Connections and Life Satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Research Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the number of close social connections relate to individuals' life satisfaction? Exploring this association can highlight the importance of social support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Variables**\n",
    "- Life Satisfaction (WELLNESS_life_satisfaction): Measures an individual's overall satisfaction with life.\n",
    "- Number of Close Friends (CONNECTION_social_num_close_friends): Indicates the quantity of close social connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use scatter plots to assess linearity for Pearson correlation, representing the association visually for the visualizations. The summary statistics are the mean and median life satisfaction for various social connectivity levels.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**C. Analysis Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the method, we calculate summary statistics and conduct a correlation analysis to assess the strength of association between social connections and life satisfaction. Our assumptions are: assumes a linear relationship and consistency in self-reported measures.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**D. Result Hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect a positive association, indicating that more close friendships may correlate with higher life satisfaction. Results may show that social connectivity enhances life satisfaction, highlighting the psychological and social benefits of friendships."
